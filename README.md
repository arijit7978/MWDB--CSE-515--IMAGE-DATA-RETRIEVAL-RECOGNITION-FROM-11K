# MWDB--CSE-515--IMAGE-DATA-RETRIEVAL-RECOGNITION-FROM-11K

•	Implemented various image feature extraction models such as Color Moments, LBP,HOG, SIFT and dimension reduction techniques such as SVD, PCA , LDA and NMF to perform  several operations like efficiently retrieve similar images, find labels etc.  according to the user given image. 

•	Performed  numerous tasks such as image labeling, clustering, classification and relevance feedback by  implementing LSH, PPR, K-means, SVM, Decision Tree and probabilistic relevance feedback system. These tasks have been completed without using libraries for SVM, Decision Tree and PPR.
